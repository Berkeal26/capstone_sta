## üîß Local Development

Frontend (CRA):

1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Create `.env.development` at project root:
   - `REACT_APP_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000`
3. Start React: `npm start`

Backend (FastAPI):

1. Ensure `backend/.env` exists with:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
   - `AMADEUS_API_KEY=vQCIIzbiTzIv7NtAStYuOGWCR6rbg3kx`
   - `AMADEUS_API_SECRET=your_amadeus_secret_here`
2. Install deps:
   - `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run API: `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000`

---

## üåê Production Notes

- Firebase Hosting serves the React build. See `firebase.json`.
- We will later add a Hosting rewrite to a Cloud Run URL for `/api/**`.
- The OpenAI key is only read on the server from `backend/.env`. It is never exposed to the browser.

## Local Dev

1) Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Test the API:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hi in 5 words"}]}'
```

2) Frontend (CRA)
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

3) Chat flow
Open http://localhost:3000 ‚Üí Home ‚Üí Start Planning ‚Üí send a message.
You should receive a GPT-3.5-Turbo reply via the backend.

---

## Render deployment

- Build command:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start command:
  - `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- Environment variables:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required)

Notes:
- Free tier instances may spin down; first request after idle can be slow.
- Ensure CORS allows `https://smart-travel-assistant-946f9.web.app` and `https://*.onrender.com`.
- Frontend production environment file (untracked) should set:
  - `.env.production` ‚Üí `REACT_APP_API_BASE=https://RENDER_SERVICE_NAME.onrender.com`

‚úÖ Dynamic conversation flow  
‚úÖ Structured response cards for travel info  
‚úÖ Basic analytics and trip summaries  

## üöÄ Amadeus API Integration

   AMADEUS_API_KEY=your_api_key
   AMADEUS_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```
3. Test connection: `python test_amadeus_api.py`
4. Run full integration test: `python backend/test_amadeus_integration.py`

### API Quotas (Free Tier)
- Flight Offers: 2,000/month
- Flight Inspiration: 3,000/month
